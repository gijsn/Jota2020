# Jota2020

This repository contains the hardware and software for the Jota2020 pcb design for Scouting Wielewaal.
This years' theme is 'the liberation of Eindhoven' after WWII.

# Backstory
The JOTA (Jamboree on the Air) is a yearly international scouting weekend where scouting ideas and experiences are shared using radios, phones, skype and other solutions. [link](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/3228/jamboree-on-the-air-jota-and-jamboree-on-the-internet-joti)
Yearly the childern at our group (ages 10 and above) are offered the opportunity to solder a pcb, which is used during one of the games, and can be used at home. The design has to be 
* Simple to explain
* Easy to solder (large, distant pads)
* Solderable in 30-40mins by a 10 year old
* Standalone
* Useful in a game
* Hard to cheat (removing power/resetting should not be advantagous)


# Design

The plan for this year is to design a FM radio that can receive 'encrypted' messages over the air so childeren can act like spies during the game

Some notes:
* Hardware is designed in KiCad
* Software is made using VSCode and Platformio
