# Jota2020

This repository contains the hardware and software for the Jota2020 pcb design.
This years' theme is 'the liberation of Eindhoven' after the second world war.
Yearly the childern (ages 10 and above) are offered the opportunity to solder a pcb, which is used during one of the games, and can be used at home

The plan for this year is to design a FM radio that can receive 'encrypted' messages over the air so childeren can act like spies during the game

Some notes:
* Hardware is designed in KiCad
* Software is made using VSCode and Platformio
